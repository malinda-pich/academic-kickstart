know the URL or exact phrase in the first place, they are also
limited to individual readings of single webpages”

**QUESTIONS TO THINK ABOUT**

* How is web archiving useful?

* Are there any ethical issues associated with web archiving? Can you think of any examples of how web archiving could generate privacy issues?

**ARTICLE**

Building Community and Tools for Analyzing Web Archives Through Datathons

This article talks about the need for studying web archives in order to better understand the social and cultural dimensions associated with the digital age 

This was achieved through community building practices in the form of Datathons 

There were many collaborators from various disciplines involved in the datathon that ranged from individuals in social sciences, to humanities and digital archivists among others.

**DISCUSSION QUESTIONS**

This article is quite clear about the large possibilities associated with studying web archives, but on the other hand, it mentions the limitations of the Wayback Machine. Although there are limitations, can you think of an area concerning social and cultural history where it can be useful to look at that platform?

The Datathons brought together people from a variety of disciplines. In what ways do you think Historians can offer insights on analyzing web archives? Does the article give insight to this?
