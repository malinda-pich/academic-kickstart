**WEB ARCHIVES**

HIST 4806

**WHAT IS A WEB ARCHIVE?**

1. It can be a "digital archive" that preserves historical information in a digitized format

2. A web archive can also act as a domain to preserve data kept online (websites)

How can a web archive be created?

* WebARChive (WARC) files

---

1. A web archive is a “digital archive” that can include, but is not limited to projects that involve digitizing historical records such as in the article “Archives Strengthening Historical Narratives: Sharing Digital And Linked Data Resources For Broader Reach And Sustainability” where the project centers on making the cultural history of Texas Coastal Bend ranching communities accessible online.

---

2. An example of a web archive that preserves websites is  the Wayback Machine founded by the Internet Archive which was mentioned in the “Building Community and Tools for Analyzing Web Archives through Datathons” article. I will get into this more in the upcoming slides. 

So how does a web archive get created? 

By creating web archives using the WARC file format, whole websites including metadata can be preserved in one single file!

[Link to a Video Explaining Web Archives](https://archive.org/embed/IntroToAIT)

This video was found on the Archive-It website. They provide web archiving services for a variety of organizations.

**THE WAYBACK MACHINE**

An internet archive that allows its users to view websites that have been captured over time

[Link to the Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/)

---

**THE WAYBACK MACHINE**

Try typing in the URL of a website. You will be able to see a snapshot of that website across time.

**THE WAYBACK MACHINE**

I typed in carleton.ca and this is where I was taken after I clicked enter

---

**THE WAYBACK MACHINE**

“This system is limited: not only do visitors largely need to
know the URL or exact phrase in the first place, they are also
limited to individual readings of single webpages”

---

**QUESTIONS TO THINK ABOUT**

* How is web archiving useful?

* Are there any ethical issues associated with web archiving? Can you think of any examples of how web archiving could generate privacy issues?

---

**ARTICLE**

Building Community and Tools for Analyzing Web Archives Through Datathons

* This article talks about the need for studying web archives in order to better understand the social and cultural dimensions associated with the digital age 

* This was achieved through community building practices in the form of Datathons 

---

Building Community and Tools for Analyzing Web Archives Through Datathons 

* There were many collaborators from various disciplines involved in the datathon that ranged from individuals in social sciences, to humanities and digital archivists among others.

---

**DISCUSSION QUESTIONS**

This article is quite clear about the large possibilities associated with studying web archives, but on the other hand, it mentions the limitations of the Wayback Machine. Although there are limitations, can you think of an area concerning social and cultural history where it can be useful to look at that platform?

The Datathons brought together people from a variety of disciplines. In what ways do you think Historians can offer insights on analyzing web archives? Does the article give insight to this?

Archives Strengthening Historical Narratives: Sharing Digital and Linked Data Resources for Broader Reach and Sustainability

* This article focuses on the development of a web archive that documents the cultural history of the Texas Coastal Bend ranching communities 

* The web archive blends a collection of oral histories, transcriptions and photographs

---

Archives Strengthening Historical Narratives: Sharing Digital and Linked Data Resources for Broader Reach and Sustainability

* This collection was particularly concerned with linking themes together to make everything more accessible: 

“To facilitate discovery of the embedded stories found in this historical region, the TCBC has focused on cross-linking related assets with an emphasis on subjects, people, and the sense of place.”
