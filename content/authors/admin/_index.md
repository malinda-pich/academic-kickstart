I am a fourth year student majoring in History. I am currently pursuing an Honours Research Project that documents oral histories of Cambodian Refugees who immigrated to Canada during the late 1970s to 1980s. Some of my interests/hobbies include singing, photography and learning new languages. I am working on being fluent in Japanese at the moment.
