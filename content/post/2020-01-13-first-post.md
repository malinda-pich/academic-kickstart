January 13th was the second meeting for the digital history course that I am taking. We covered a variety of topics in class that included going over some of the assigned readings as well as working together on ideas of what a museum is. We ended up generating many keywords as a group to describe what a museum is and what concepts are related to the museum. I think the idea of preservation and what should be preseved is really interesting. One of the assigned readings talked about what it means to First Nations communities to preserve culture and some of the problems around that idea. What I found particularly interesting about this class was an assignment related to archaeology that we worked on in groups. We attempted to solve a puzzle based on a chart we were given and had to come up with the order and timeline on what sections of an archeology site were dug first. It has been a bit of a struggle so far trying to get my netlify site up and running, however I think the more that I work with it the easier it should be for subsequent posts.
