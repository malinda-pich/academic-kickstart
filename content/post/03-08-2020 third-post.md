A lot of things have happened since my last devlog post. It has been awhile updating them and I realize that I need to spend more time on this part to ensure everything is up to date. It would also be useful to have some notes to look back on as the larger project for the term begins to develop. In my last post, I talked about visiting the Museum of History and having a look at their collections. Since then, I have also visited the Museum of Nature. I have chosen to work on the Museum of Nature team and will be trying to digitize the archaeofaunal records. 
The team and I went to visit the Museum of Nature on our own time to try and understand what exactly we will be working with; the nature of the collection and all the parts that go with it. Overall there were three parts to the data we were presented with. There was a logbook that was handwritten and kept track of details such as the archeological site and who was responsible for surveying that site among other things. There was also a large catalogue where each line corresponded to animal fossils found at that site and information about those items. This included scientific names, general names and the type of bone found. The last item that we looked at were the catalogue cards. These catalogue cards were organized by item number and corresponded to one line within the large catalogue book. 
We then decided how we were going to work with the data, and so we took pictures of each part of the collection and created a onedrive folder to upload the photos. We decided to work on one archaeological site at a time. 
At this point we decided the best thing to do is reconvene at another time and discuss with Professor Graham whether what we were doing was a good start. We had a follow-up meeting with the group and the Professor to see the next steps on what we can do to digitize the photos. 
I downloaded the Python software onto my computer and will begin trying to work with the program to digitize the photos.
