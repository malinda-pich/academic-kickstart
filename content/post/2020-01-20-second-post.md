It has been quite awhile since I had last visited the Museum of History. It was extremely interesting to learn more about the private side of the museum. We were given a brief presentation on the history of the museum and what sort of collections that the institution houses. We also had the privlege of getting a tour which revealed how different people work in the museum. There are certain people with specialties in conservation that help to maintain and preserve artifacts. We entered an artifact room that contained various canoes and other objects that the museum has collected, but are not on display in the public areas. We learned a little about how these objects are organized and how to find them in the system. I took a few pictures which I intend on uploading once I figure out more so how to use github and tropy. Hopefully by my third devlog post I will have learned how to do it! Overall it was a very fascinating experience and I definitely enjoyed learning more about what goes on behind the museum.
